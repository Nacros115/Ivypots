To use the WizFi360 Arduino library, the development environment must be configured to use the Arduino platform.

Please note that in this guide examples were configured and tested using Arduino IDE in a Windows environment.

Before starting, download and install the Arduino IDE from the link below.

    Arduino IDE

Additionally, if you are using WizFi360-EVB-Pico, minor settings are required in the Arduino IDE.

WizFi360-EVB-Pico is an development board based on RP2040, and you need to add a package to use the development board based on RP2040.

① Run the Arduino IDE

② Open Preferences

You can open it through 'File → Preferences' in the menu bar of Arduino IDE.

③ Add next link to Additional Boards Manager URL
